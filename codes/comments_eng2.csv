In my perspective, I think that haters/anti's are just trying to spam continuously on both Stay Gold and How You Like That M/V's to make us think that us fandoms are the ones behind it. As a true Army, We never even planned on sabotaging your goals and still respected you guys and BP. So please, dont blame this on us and just report them.  But I saw some part of your fandom thinking that we are the one's behind this and started commenting the same thing to get ""revenge"", and I really don't think that's acceptable and it's just making your fandom's reputation go down. All i'm asking is to just realize that neither of us are a part of this and that it's the haters fault who started this whole chaos, thank you.From, Army+No fanwars please :(+And no, i'm not saying that the ""toxic one's"" are Armies, but K-pop Haters I hope you understand..+Don't post a link to your video please my comment is not a promotion market :v"

Just a disclaimer NOT ALL BLINKS WERE REAL BLINKS specially those who throw hate to others kpop groups/fandoms. So WE THE REAL BLINKS want to apologize on the behalf of the immature blonks. We waited for soooo long just to support our girls comeback so we’re not here to hate or start a war. I hope this fanwar will end not tomorrow nor later but now, because it’s totally NONSENSE, a WASTE OF TIME and full of INSECURE, IMMATURE and JUDGMENTAL people."
