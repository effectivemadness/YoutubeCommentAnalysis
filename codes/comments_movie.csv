             cacaf           ,55.0,this is one of the best movies ever made is an understatement. This is the best movie ever made.

             flawless mr           ,21.0,You can definitely make an argument for Parasite to be the film of decade. It's just this good. The details of this film are insane. Every single scene and screen shot are very well composed
             John Doe           ,31.0,You look like Scarlett Johansson
             Annex           ,48.0,"Bong Joon-Ho’s ‘Parasite’ rocked me to my core. This is one of the best films of the decade. Groundbreaking, trailblazing, meticulous, fearless, audacious, bold and beautiful filmmaking. A Korean specialty. It was a full house with a diverse group. Rarely have I been more invested, holding my bated breath, clenching my ass, bracing myself, racked with tension, suspense, and anticipation. Never knowing what was gonna happen next or how it was gonna unfold. No fair guessing. Nothing can prepare you for this experience. No, it’s not a geek show but a endlessly, deliriously inventive and wickedly entertaining commentary between the rich and poor. The class divide. The haves and have not. Victims of circumstance vs. privilege.Talk about first rate performances! Talk about pitch perfect casting! A flawless screenplay. Precise cinematography, editing, and art direction. Memorable score.I look for tone, mood, aesthetic and Soul (Seoul)(!). Bong is playing us like a piano and I love it!How refreshing to experience a film other than through American sensibilities. It is darkly hilarious, tragic, heartbreaking, deeply satirical, profound, thought provoking, and Devastating! Must be vague, but Jordan Peele meets Tarantino is fair. Get ready, you won’t be able to shake off this film easily, it surprised the hell outta me."
             Myo C           ,9.0,This movie keeps pulling me up all the way 😍 and let me think over and over after all ..!!
             Jessica Lee           ,17.0,"Absolute masterpiece of a film. The pure brilliance is in the execution as I cannot imagine how any other director besides Bong Joon-Ho could have made this film as good as it is. My favourite scene was when the Kim family had to return to their basement home to try save it from the rainstorm. It was so incredibly powerful. You could really sense and feel the hardships that these less fortunate people have to endure, whereas upper class citizens are just entirely oblivious to their struggles."
             Adnen Boultif           ,24.0,"Finally you watch it.... And yes this 2019 best movie, you can't miss it, a true masterpiece! Thanks for the review waiting for the spoiler review 🥰"

             Cine Beng           ,0.0,"I wasn’t impressed by the trailers... but my oh my! I was so surprised by this movie! I watched it in July... three months before you and I have since watched it three times! Hehe.Even though I have seen most of his movies (Mother, The Host, Okja, Snowpiercer, Memories of Murder, Barking dogs never bite), I wasn’t prepared for the twists and turns ...... me and my friend were rooting for it to win best foreign film after we have watched it. We started getting very excited when it was nominated for Best Pic.... thankfully it was a happy ever after for Asian audiences like us. And this best part is... it’s win was a well deserved one! There’s no way this film is going to appear in “Movies that shouldn’t win Best Pic” list, hehe."
             Jimmy Dance           ,0.0,"This movie is so great and at the end, you started to realize that the director is just using the ""poor vs rich"" as a disguise and there is much about good vs evil and hatred vs love. The one whom died at the end is probably the best human being and the most evil one actually survived but keep getting tortured. The definition of ""revenge"" also has been refreshed, in the situation when your love one got hurt and about to die, somehow you should should not take your anger towards the one who directly hurt you, but rather the one that discriminated you, the emotional damage is much bigger than the physical one. This movie is so deep."

             ST에스티           ,21.0,"I watched it when it was just opened in Korea, and I had to watch it again to understand what Director Bong wanted to show us. And I still cannot say I understand this film 100% sure. What really funny thing is this film is easy to understand and hard to understand at the same time I believe. I think this is a movie version of the little prince as every watchers will have personalised impression."
             박지호           ,0.0,"Hi, I enjoyed your review. I live in Korea. Can I recommend a movie? Let me tell you about the movie that was a ray of light for me. It's a Korean movie called ""Castaway on the Moon 2009"" that gave me more confidence in my lethargic life and time to reflect on myself. Friends, when you are as complicated and lethargic as I am, I hope you watch the Korean movie Mr. Kim drifting. ^^* korean subtitle ""김씨 표류기"""
             Austin Garcia           ,4.0,2019 is shaping up to be one of the best years for movies in a long time. Still so many films that have been getting great reviews out of Canne and Tiff. I’m expecting to be in the theatre at least once a week these next 3 months.
