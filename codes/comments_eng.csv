In my perspective, I think that haters/anti's are just trying to spam continuously on both Stay Gold and How You Like That M/V's to make us think that us fandoms are the ones behind it. As a true Army, We never even planned on sabotaging your goals and still respected you guys and BP. So please, dont blame this on us and just report them.  But I saw some part of your fandom thinking that we are the one's behind this and started commenting the same thing to get ""revenge"", and I really don't think that's acceptable and it's just making your fandom's reputation go down. All i'm asking is to just realize that neither of us are a part of this and that it's the haters fault who started this whole chaos, thank you.From, Army+No fanwars please :(+And no, i'm not saying that the ""toxic one's"" are Armies, but K-pop Haters I hope you understand..+Don't post a link to your video please my comment is not a promotion market :v",    2.4만
